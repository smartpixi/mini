----------------------------------
  ENHANCEMENTS

      16K to 64K (#pragma maxarray).

Hex Workshop v4.22 - January 2004
---------------------------------
  BUG FIXES
    - Drag and drop was non-functional when running under Windows 9x/ME.
    - The Hex Workshop help facility failed to launch and/or work
      correctly if "roboex32.dll" was not present on a user's system.

      program directory.
    - The editor display could fail to repaint/redraw properly after a
      scrolling through large files or resizing the window many times.
      This problem was caused by resource leak in Hex Workshop, however,
      only surfaced under Windows 9x/ME.
    - Drag and drop was broken under Windows 9x/ME.
    - Hex Workshop data operations were incorrect when processing 16 bit
      or larger adds, substracts, multiples, divides, mod, and change
      signed operations.  Additionally, the data operation dialogs now
      recall the last used settings.
    - "Hex Edit with Hex Workshop" failed to appear on the right-click
      context menu of some file types.  An icon is now displayed in the

---------------------------------
  BUG FIXES

      "inetwh32.dll" into the Hex Workshop program directory. 
    - The file open dialog failed to open on Windows 9x and NT 4.0.
      This problem was introduced as a side effect of upgrading from 
      MSVC 6.0 to Microsoft .NET 2003.
    - Hex Workshop failed to run on Windows 95 with an error message
      claiming that it needed "oleacc.dll".  This problem was introduced

      2003.
 
      
Hex Workshop v4.20 - January 2004
---------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES
    - The Structure Viewer now supports 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit bitfields.
      A bitfield as defined by the C language allows users to modify and
      manipulate data without manually counting, shifting, or masking
      bits.
    - Users can now specify the data type length when exporting data as
      C source or Java source.  8, 16, 32, and 64 bit data types and
      byte swapping are also supported.
    - Hex Workshop can now be used to export data in the Base64 and
      UUEncoding formats.  Copy-As support is also available.
    - Users can now modify the starting offset and view file offsets in
      terms of bytes (default), number of words (bytes/2), or dwords
      (bytes/4).  The offset display is controlled by right clicking on
      the address column of the hex display.
    - Bookmarks are now easier to use and more useful.  The result of
      selecting or double-clicking a bookmark is different:
      - Selecting bookmark: Scrolls the bookmark into view without
        changing the cursor position.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's address: Moves the cursor position to
        the bookmark's address.
      - Double-clicking length: Selects the bookmark data within the
        editor.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's description: Allows you to edit the
        description in place.
      - Double-clicking bookmark's value: If a data type was supplied,
        allows you to edit the data in place.
    - The Results Window has new "Output" tab to aid in development of
      structure definitions.  Debugging information and errors are
      displayed in the "Output" window whenever a user opens a new
      structure definition file.
    - The Structure Viewer's right-click popup menu now contains menu
      entries for "Copy" and "Edit".
    - The Export As dialog now contains a button to modify export
      preferences.  This allows users to more easily change their export
      preferences.
    - F2 may now be used to begin editing the selected structure viewer
      value.
    - Ctrl+C now copies values to the clipboard from the Data Inspector
      and Structure Viewer.

  BUG FIXES
    - Hex Workshop's failure to read all sectors on large disks.
    - Motorola S-Records were not imported correctly when records 
      overlapped or records were out of order.
    - Typo in ANSI character map (online help).
    - Failure of the delete key to remove the selected bookmark.
    - Removed the left and right scroll buttons from the Data
      Inspector's and Results Window's tab control.
    - Defaults file extensions were not applied when changing format
      types in the Export As dialog.
    - Redraw problems when repositioning floating structures containing
      array elements.
    - "Junk entires" are no longer left after collapsing some structure
      definitions.
    - Structure Viewer parsing problems for "typedef enum".
    - Structure Viewer parsing/evaluation problems for signed and
      unsigned modifiers.

Hex Workshop v4.10 - May 2003
-----------------------------
  NEW FEATURES
    - The Hex Workshop Structure Viewer now supports variable length
      arrays.  This allows users to define the length of an array based
      one of the structure's own data members
    - Hex Workshop now handles simple expressions embedded within an
      array length definition.
    - Users can now define their own data types using the "typedef"
      feature.
    - The Hex Workshop structure facility now supports enumerated types.
      Enumerated types allow users to create human readable identifiers
      for unique numeric values.  
    - Hex Workshop Structure Libraries can now reference other structure
      libraries by using a #include directive.  This feature offers
      users better control and organization of their structure files. 
    - End users can now calculate up to 12 different checksums within
      Hex Workshop.  The latest checksum algorithm allows users to
      define a 16 bit or 32 bit CRC by supplying the polynomial, initial
      value, reflective properties, and final XOR value.
    - When clicking the right mouse button over the offset portion of
      the hex editing display, a new context menu is displayed with
      various offset related options: 
      - Switch between hexadecimal and decimal addresses.
      - Specify a starting offset value.
      - Modify how Hex Workshop calculates offset addresses in the hex
        editing display.
      - Modify the length of digits displayed in document offsets.
      - Execute the Hex Workshop Goto command.
    - When importing Intel Hex Code or Motorola S-Records, users can now
      specify the fill byte used for unspecified data regions.
    - When working with big Endian binary files, users can now swap the
      order of bytes display in the editor.

  BUG FIXES
    - Prior to v4.10, imported Intel Hex Code documents could be
      corrupted when records overlapped.  This problem has been
      addressed. 
    - Prior to v4.10, if users clicked on a read-only portion of the
      structure viewer display instead of an editable element, editing
      was not initiated upon pressing F2.  Now, pressing F2 will invoke
      the in-placing edit feature for bookmarks, structures, and the
      data inspector whenever an element has active focus.
    - When an element in the structure viewer has active focus, pressing
      the left and right arrow keys will now collapse or expand the
      structure.
