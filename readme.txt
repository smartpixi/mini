-[ Description ]--------------------------------------------------------

The Hex Workshop Hex Editor by BreakPoint Software is a complete set
of hexadecimal development tools for Microsoft Windows 2000 and later.
Hex Workshop integrates advanced binary editing and data interpretation
and visualization with the ease and flexibility of a modern word
processor.  With the Hex Workshop, you can edit, cut, copy, paste,
insert, fill and delete binary data.  You can also work with data in
its native structure and data types using our integrated structure
viewer and smart bookmarks.  Data editing is quick and easy with our
extensive features that allow you to: jump to file or sector location,
find or replace data, perform arithmetic, bitwise, and logical
operations, binary compare files, generate checksums and digests, view
character distributions and export data to RTF or HTML for publishing.

Hex Workshop includes a Sector Editor with disk imaging tools, a Base
Converter for converting between hex, decimal and binary data types, a 
Hex Calculator supporting arithmetic and bitwise operations, an 
expression calculator supporting variables, conditionals, iteration
and arithmetic and bitwise operations, and a data visualizer designed
to help you visually identify patterns and interesting data from 
rendered images.  Also included is our Data Inspector that allows you
to quickly edit and view data in decimal, floating point or time and 
date representations.

The Hex Workshop Hex Editor v6.8 or lower is available at a retail
price of $89.95 (with volume and academic discounts and site licenses
available).  For more information, visit the Hex Workshop web site at
http://www.hexworkshop.com or send e-mail inquiries to

Key Features:
- Rich Feature Set
- Highly Customizable User Interface
- Data Interpretation, Visualization and Parsing
- Integrated Binary Comparison

Rich Feature Set
----------------
Hex Workshop features a broad and powerful set of features ranging
from the ability to color map data sequences to the interpretation of
data though our integrated structure viewer and smart bookmarks.  Our
many features include: binary data editing, importing and exporting
blocks of data, searching for data by hex strings, text, Unicode,
bitmasks, or decimal values, viewing character distributions, sector
editing, embedded data operations, binary file comparison, and
import/export capabilities.

Highly Customizable User Interface
----------------------------------
Hex Workshop allows users to customize the look of the main editor
window through user definable color settings for the data and
backgrounds and also through the ability to define how and what data
will be displayed.  Users can adjust the grouping of hex data, the
number of bytes display per line, offset lengths, offset bases, etc.
Panels can be docked or pinned to maximize your editing workspace.  

Integrated tools allow users to color code and tag data within the
editor.  For example, while viewing a structure in Hex Workshop, users
are able to color graphically see the data ranges of structure
members.  All color coding is user definable. 

Data Interpretation, Visualization and Parsing
----------------------------------------------
Four integrated tools are available to help parse and combine data
within Hex Workshop. 
 
1) The Structure Viewer applies C-style structures to data within the
   editor and allows the user to visually view and edit that data.

2) Smart Bookmarks allow users to add bookmarks to a file with
   functions, mathematical operations, and data types.   Users can
   view and edit both the bookmark and the bookmark's value.

3) Color maps allow users to apply color attributes to hex sequences
   or character ranges to help identify data within a file.

4) The Data Visualizer allows users to apply color palettes to their
   data to help identify patterns.

Integrated Binary Comparison
----------------------------
Integrated resynchronizing binary comparisons allow users to compare
binary files and review each difference.   Starting offsets, lengths,
and compare parameters, and color renderings are all user-definable.

-[ Upgrade Notes ]------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading from Hex Workshop v6.5, v6.6, and v6.7
------------------------------------------------
Hex Workshop v6.8 will import most user settings from v6.x if users allow
the Hex Workshop installer to uninstall Hex Workshop v6.x (i.e. do not
uninstall it first).  Alternatively, users can export their settings
from Hex Workshop v6.x ("All Settings" from Preferences) and import 
their settings into Hex Workshop v6.8  The following settings are not
migrated as part of installation:
 - Auto-loaded Structure Libraries
 - Bookmark file associations
 - Version Check settings

Upgrading from Hex Workshop v6.0
--------------------------------
Hex Workshop v6.8 will import most user settings from v6.0 if users allow
the Hex Workshop installer to uninstall Hex Workshop v6.0 (i.e. do not
uninstall it first) or if users select a Side-By-Side install.  The
following settings are not migrated as part of installation:
 - Auto-loaded Structure Libraries
 - Docking window positions and state
 - Bookmark file associations
 - Version Check settings
 
Upgrading from Hex Workshop v5.0 or earlier
-------------------------------------------
Settings and options are not migrated forward for earlier versions of
Hex Workshop.

Side-By-Side Installation Option
--------------------------------
The Hex Workshop installer includes an option to install Hex Workshop
v6.8 alongside another Hex Workshop installation (Side-By-Side
install).  However, we discourage users from installing multiple
versions of Hex Workshop as the right-click content menu and Microsoft
privilege escalation (used for sector editing under Vista and later)
will no longer work for the previous version and may reset when
switching between versions.  A reboot is required after a Side-By-Side
installation.

No-cost Upgrade Eligibility
---------------------------
With Hex Workshop v6.0, BreakPoint Software moved to a maintenance
policy which requires a contract for upgrade entitlements.  Users
purchasing Hex Workshop v6.0 or higher are entitled to a 1 year
maintenance period after their purchase. Please visit:

    http://www.bpsoft.com/support/

and follow the link for "Maintenance Status" to check your eligibility
for a no-cost upgrade.  Customers within a maintenance period can upgrade
to Hex Workshop v6.8 at no cost.  Links for discounted upgrades and
maintenance extensions are also provided. 

NOTE: Users may need to re-enter their registration unlocking key and
re-download a new license for their upgrade to Hex Workshop v6.8

Structure Library Changes
-------------------------
Hex Workshop v6.5 and later defines the following keywords as basic 
types:

  Byte, UByte, Word, UWord, DWord, UDWord, QWord, UQWord, HalfFloat

If users have defined these types within their Structure Libraries,
they must undefined them or change the type names.  Please see Hex
Workshop's online help for a complete list of reserved words and
